# Binary Search on One Dimension

### 1. [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
Approach:
- Simple Binary Search Algorithm
- TC = O(logN) & SC = O(1)

### 2. [Lower Bound](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/lower-bound_8165382)
Approach:
* Simple Binary Search but while selecting the left part keep the index handy
* TC = O(logN) & SC = O(1)

### 3. [Upper Bound](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/implement-upper-bound_8165383?utm_source=striver&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=a_zcoursetuf)
Approach:
* Same as above with minor modification
* TC = O(logN) & SC = O(1)

### 4. [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/)
Approach:
* Do Binary search and return if found, otherwise return low
* TC = O(logN) & SC = O(1)
