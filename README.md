## Learn the Basics:
### Logical Thinking - Pattern Problems
To solve any pattern problem remember these 4 rules:
1. For the outer loop, count the number of lines (rows).
2. For the inner loop, count the number of columns & connect them to rows.
3. Always print the content inside the inner loop
4. For symmetry patterns, implement the upper half first and then the bottom half.
